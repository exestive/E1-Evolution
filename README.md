# E1-Evolution
Second Semester - Second Project

Here we have got our second semester Project on "Designing virtual bargain-finder Robot".
Make sure you are following this readme file each week in order to get our project done and dusted on time.
You can track the group's members activities in brief at top of the page by the time performed by each member.

To use our VRBH download the E1 Game folder and run the file called main.py
